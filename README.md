# Cancer Cells Prediction – Machine Learning Project

Team ASTRA | Employability.life XPro Program (AI Track)

#Overview

This project implements a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict whether cancer cells are benign or malignant. The work covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, evaluation, and documentation.

#Features

* Clean and preprocessed medical dataset
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost)
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
* Complete documentation included (SRS, PM Plan, PPT)
